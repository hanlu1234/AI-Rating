You are a senior QA engineer. Based on the provided PRD about introducing five new showtypes (number, range, number_unit, range_unit, sequential_combobox) and standardized unit handling with multilingual support, generate a complete set of test cases in an XMind-friendly outline structure.

Format your response as a plain-text hierarchical list using consistent indentation (2 spaces per level). Use the following structure:

- [Feature Area]
  - [Test Scenario]
    - TC01: [Clear, actionable test case title]
      - Precondition: ...
      - Steps: ...
      - Expected Result: ...
    - TC02: ...

Cover all key areas:
1. VTyler (CPV Management Tool)
2. PV Definition Assistant Tool
3. Product Editor (Supplier UI)
4. Supplier Offer Data Model & APIs
5. PDP (Product Detail Page)
6. Validation Rules (including edge cases)
7. Multilingual Unit Display
8. System Compatibility (Mobile, Search, Filters)

Include positive, negative, and boundary test cases. Ensure all 5 new showtypes are thoroughly tested. Highlight where free text in sequential_combobox must NOT affect search/filters.

Do NOT use markdown. Use only plain text with indentation.
