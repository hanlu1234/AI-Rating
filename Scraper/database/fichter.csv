 Do you need extremely precise components or a particularly high surface quality? 
 
 CNC contract surface grinding: Precise machining of your components for maximum dimensional and geometrical accuracy. 
 Flexible capacity utilization: Available for existing workpieces or as a supplementary manufacturing step to our services. 
 
 Contract surface grinding – Your advantages 
 
 Maximum precision & surface quality: Guarantees low roughness and excellent dimensional and geometrical accuracy of your workpieces. 
 Consistent results: State-of-the-art CNC grinding machines ensure high machining quality and precision, ideal for series production. 
 Flexible capacity utilization: Gain access to manufacturing capacities without your own investments in technology or know-how. 
 Benefit from experience: Take advantage of our expertise in surface grinding directly. 
 
 Services and possibilities of surface grinding 
 In CNC surface grinding, the grinding tool moves computer-controlled over the workpiece. For this purpose, a machining pattern is defined in advance, in which the grinding machine then precisely removes material evenly at the desired points. 
 This method is precise and efficient and is suitable for individual parts as well as for small series. Workpieces of up to 600x300x400 mm can be machined. Aluminum surface grinding, stainless steel surface grinding, but also surface grinding of steel or hardened tool steel is possible. 
 Areas of application for surface grinding 
 Surface grinding of workpieces is particularly useful in areas that require the highest accuracy of fit or for applications in which precision plays a major role, such as the automotive, aerospace, or mechanical and plant engineering industries. However, we manufacture components for every application according to your individual requirements. We manufacture these according to your drawings or create the CAD models ourselves. 
 New milestone in our production: The FS 840 Connect surface grinding machine from Geibel and Hotz 
 In modern manufacturing, the ability to create precise and uniform surfaces is essential. Surface grinding is a crucial process in metalworking, in which workpieces are machined by grinding on a flat surface. This method not only enables exact dimensioning but also excellent surface quality. However, in order to achieve the required tolerances and surface qualities, high-quality machines are necessary that guarantee extreme accuracy and reliability. 
 The FS 840 Connect surface grinding machine sets new standards in precision and efficiency. With its robust design and innovative technology, the FS 840 Connect is designed to meet even the most demanding requirements of industrial manufacturing. 
 An outstanding feature of the FS 840 Connect is its intelligent control system, which enables seamless integration into existing production lines. Thanks to state-of-the-art sensor technology and automation techniques, this surface grinding machine ensures precise grinding results, minimizes material loss and significantly increases productivity. 
 In addition, the FS 840 Connect offers a user-friendly interface that enables easy operation and maintenance. This allows even less experienced operators to work efficiently with the machine and ensure the quality of the parts produced. 
 The introduction of the FS 840 Connect marks another step in precision machining in our company. An ideal solution that values the highest quality and efficiency and optimizes our production processes.

 Machine structure 
 The operation of the SF25 automatic press is very simple. The workpiece to be formed is inserted into the machining opening and usually positioned by means of a stop; it stands still while the forming jaws move axially onto the workpiece. The corresponding parameters for machining can be stored and managed in the machine control. The user interface allows simple, logical operation. All functionally important processes are electronically monitored and the data recorded in the control system. This ensures a high level of process reliability and reproducibility.

 Sleeves with cables or hoses 
 Housings with connectors 
 Hoses and pipes 
 Sensors with cable 
 
 Space-saving model with a compact design - perfect for small workshops or mobile use. 
 With the motorized press, you can achieve a form-fitting connection, including improved strain relief, anti-rotation protection, or shielding. 
 A typical application, for example, is to mechanically secure connecting cables in sensor sleeves against being pulled out and to seal them at the same time. In addition, this process can be used to flange connectors into sensor housings and much more. Wall thicknesses from 0.2 mm up to approx. 1.0 mm with a diameter of 3 to 25 mm are possible. 
 The SF25 compact was specially developed for components that are to be inserted vertically from above or below between the crimping jaws into the machine. It is mainly used in areas with little space and in semi- or fully automated systems, e.g. rotary table feed with lifting station, robot loading and pick & place systems. 
 Machine structure 
 The machine is very easy to operate. The workpiece to be formed is inserted into the machining opening, usually positioned by means of a stop, it stands still while the forming jaws move axially onto the workpiece.

 Exaktes Trennen von Bauteilen mit hoher Wiederholgenauigkeit – sicher, schnell und prozessstabil. 
 Die spanlose Trennmaschine RS25 ist eine hochentwickelte Anlage, die für die materialschonende und präzise Trennung von Werkstoffen ohne den Verlust von Späne entwickelt wurde. Insbesondere in Industrien, die eine effiziente und saubere Verarbeitung von Metallen und anderen Materialien verlangen, ist der RS25 eine gefragte Wahl. Seine Technologie ermöglicht das präzise Trennen und Schneiden von Werkstücken ohne Abfall. Dank der innovativen Funktionsweise und herausragenden Spezifikationen bietet die Trennmaschine eine kostengünstige und umweltfreundliche Lösung für die industrielle Fertigung. Sie findet in der Metallverarbeitung, im Maschinenbau und in der Automobilindustrie Verwendung, wo hohe Produktionsgeschwindigkeit und saubere Schnitte erforderlich sind. Die RS25 ist ideal, um Produktionsprozesse zu optimieren und zugleich Materialkosten zu senken. 
 Schneiden ohne Materialverlust mit RS25 
 Die Funktion des RS25 beruht auf einer innovativen spanlosen Technik, bei der das Werkstück ohne Materialverlust getrennt oder geformt wird. Dabei wird das Material zunächst positioniert und fest eingespannt. Die Trennmaschine übt dann einen gleichmäßigen Druck aus, der das Werkstück in die gewünschte Form oder Größe schneidet, ohne Späne oder Materialverluste zu verursachen. Durch den kontrollierten Trennvorgang ist eine gleichmäßige Kraftverteilung garantiert, so werden Risse oder Verformungen vermieden. 
 Die spanlose Trennmaschine RS25 zeichnet sich durch eine Reihe technischer Spezifikationen aus, die ihn zu einer leistungsstarken, langlebigen und zuverlässigen Trennmaschine machen: 
 
 Arbeitsbereich: Ein großzügiger Arbeitsbereich erlaubt es, Werkstücke unterschiedlicher Größe zu bearbeiten. 
 Geschwindigkeit und Präzision: Die spanlose Trennmaschine ist darauf ausgelegt, Werkstücke schnell und präzise zu bearbeiten, was ihn besonders in hochvolumigen Produktionsprozessen vorteilhaft macht. 
 Wartungsarmut: Mit robusten Komponenten und einem durchdachten Design ist die Maschine auf eine lange Lebensdauer und geringe Wartungsanforderungen ausgelegt. 
 
 Die spanlose Trennmaschine RS25 ist äußerst flexibel und eignet sich für eine Vielzahl an Materialien. Darunter Metalle wie Aluminium, Stahl, Kupfer und Edelstahl, spezielle Kunststoffe, die in der industriellen Fertigung verwendet werden, sowie komplexe Metalllegierungen, die sich schwer trennen lassen.
