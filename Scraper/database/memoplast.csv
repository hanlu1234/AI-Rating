Our modular master mold system and state-of-the-art technologies enable us to produce your small batches quickly, precisely, and flexibly – perfect for testing new products on the market or fulfilling customized orders. 
 In our small series production, your injection molded parts are manufactured on conventional injection molding machines from original series material. Depending on your needs, our small series injection molds are equipped with slides and hot runners – just like series tools. The decisive difference lies in the material of the mold: Instead of steel, we use a high-strength aluminum alloy. Studies have shown that this material has no measurable influence on the component properties. This way, you receive near-series parts that correspond in appearance and function to series components from steel molds. 
 Our small series tools also benefit from our proven memoplast master mold system. This modular system, like our prototype tools, saves valuable time and costs in tool creation. Unlike prototype tools, we enable the demolding of undercuts through automatically moving slides – exactly as in series production. The tool itself is made from a high-strength aluminum, allowing us to achieve service lives of more than 100,000 parts, depending on the component geometry, number of cavities, and the plastic used. 
 Our small series production is ideal for small to medium batch sizes where a series mold is not yet cost-effective. You can already supply the market with a small series while the series mold is still under development. Furthermore, tool changes and dimensional adjustments are easily possible in this process, which offers you maximum flexibility in product development. 
 In our small series production, we process almost all plastics and can also implement a variety of special injection molding processes, such as insert molding or two-component injection molding. This versatility allows us to meet individual requirements and produce a wide range of products. 
 Our small series production is suitable for quantities from 50 up to approximately 10,000 parts per year or for one-off batch sizes of up to 100,000 parts. If you only need a small quantity, our prototype injection molding might also be of interest to you. We would be happy to provide you with a free quote for your small series – contact us now and let's realize your product idea together.

 High-precision prototype production with rapid tooling at memoplast 
 We rely on the latest technologies and rapid tooling for prototype production in order to produce near-series plastic injection-molded parts of the highest quality. We use original materials that correspond to the later series components in terms of both their appearance and their mechanical strength. Our modular memoplast master mold system enables flexible and efficient production, regardless of the complexity of the prototype. This master mold system combines many of the basic functions of an injection molding tool. This has enabled us to reduce production to its essentials: the cavity. In the prototype tool, undercuts on the component are demolded using manual inserts. This saves additional costs and time in tool production. Our prototype tools are made from high-strength aluminum. This means that, depending on the component geometry and the plastic used, we can achieve service lives of up to 50,000 parts. Almost all plastics can be processed, and a wide range of special injection molding processes, such as insert technology or two-component injection molding, can be implemented. 
 Thanks to advanced CAD/CAM systems and precise processing techniques, we achieve exceptional Dimensional accuracy and surface quality, which is essential for the development and testing of new products. Unlike purely generative processes such as 3D printing, our injection molding process offers a significant advantage: It enables the production of functional prototypes that replicate all the characteristics of series production. 
 With a clear focus on sustainability, we also rely on a resource-saving use of raw materials. In this way, we guarantee not only high-quality and precisely fitting prototype production, but also responsible production. 
 Our rapid tooling process is particularly suitable for component testing. After component testing, you can continue to make dimensional and design adjustments until the component perfectly meets your requirements. This avoids expensive tool changes in the subsequent series production. Our prototype production is optimal for quantities of 10 to approximately 5,000 parts. If you are planning a larger quantity, you should consider a tool for a small series. We would be happy to provide you with a free quote for your component.
