 When the small amount of powder additives or liquid is required to be added into the bulk material, FluidizedBedMixer / Twin Shaft Paddle Mixers are able to achieve fast and precision mixing with high capacity. 
 The PerMix PFB series Twin Shaft Paddle Mixer or Non-gravity Mixer consists of paddles with special angles that are mounted on twin shafts in a ‘W’ shaped trough. During operation, the two shafts are rotating in opposite directions. 
 The paddles sweep the entire bottom of both troughs, and materials are lifted floating between the two shafts (as zero-gravity zone) by the centrifugal force generated by the paddles. At this weightless zone, mixing of materials of different density is easy and fast because material particle can move freely and randomly, regardless of particle size and density. This brings a rapid and highly homogenous mixing. 
 
 Very fast mixing to supply a typical mixing time from 10 seconds to only 1 minute 
 Free particle movement 
 Minimal heat and low shear for shear and heat sensitive materials (Due to the low friction and lack of shear in this non-gravity zone, the PerMix PFB series Fluidized Bed Mixer / Twin Shaft Paddle Mixer is an ideal machine for fragile products that cannot tolerate rough handling. Even flakes or spray-dried bodies remain intact after mixing)

In the Inline process, the mixer is installed outside the tank. 
 This makes it easy to be built into an existing production line with normal inlet/outlet connections. In the case to deal with liquid with a low viscosity, the inline mixer can pump the liquid without an additional pump. 
 That is why it is also called High Shear Pump. The mixer can be used to deal with the product in a single pass or with several circulations to make the product better. Different from a Batch High Shear Mixer, the mixing occurs in the mixing chamber, thus energy is introduced onto materials in the most efficient way. This also cuts the process times by up to 90% 
 Step 1. When the rotor is driven by the motor, it rotates at a very high speed of several thousands rpm. A powerful suction is generated at its center and draws both solids and liquids from the inlet pipe into the working chamber. 
 Step 2.Centrifugal force leads the materials to the periphery. Materials are subjected to intensive squeezing and milling at the precision machined clearance between rotor and stator. High pressure is created there too due to the gathering of materials, which makes the impact between particles more remarkable. 
 Step 3. Followed is another intense hydraulic shear as the materials are forced out through the openings in the stator at very high velocity. When material particles arrive outside of the stator, they tend to explode into thousands of even smaller ones as the pressure drops down sharply. 
 Step 4. Fresh materials are continually drawn into the stator-rotor maintaining the circulation or single-pass flow 
 PerMix also designs two types of Stator & Rotor systems: K type and V type. Both have several sub-types. These designs of stator & rotor systems offers more selections for our customers to choose the most suitable one to deal with their specific liquids and solids. 
 Multi-stage & Multi-row Stator/Rotor – Rows: Every stator and every rotor have one or several rows of “teeth” (K-type, stator and rotor), or “blades” (V-type, rotor), or “screens” (V-type, stator). 
 – Stages: PerMix supplies PC1 series Single-stage Inline Mixer, and PC3 series Multi-stage Inline Mixer. PC3 series Inline Mixers have three sets of stator & rotor. Standard PC3 Mixer includes sets of coarse, intermediate and fine stator & rotor assemblies. PC3 Series Inline Mixer is applied to deal with difficult-to-disperse materials, or when customers require single-pass processing. 
 The multi-stage (usually 3-stage) inline mixer has 3 sets of stator/ rotor systems to enhance its shearing performance. This design dramatically reduce processing time, and in some cases only one pass through the mixer can lead to satisfied products. Depending on the materials to be processed and customer requirements, for each stator/rotor, there can be only one row, or multi-row of teeth. Besides, PerMix provides coarse, medium and fine teeth to achieve different shearing intensity. 
 Special Design with Ultra-high Speed PerMix designs the ultra-high speed inline mixer with the tip speed of about 40m/s. The ultra-high speed inline mixer is belt driven to increase the rotation speed of the rotor up to 12,000rpm (Model: PC-1/60, pilot size). 
 The thermosiphon is used to store and cool the buffer liquid for the double mechanical seals, operated as a closed circuit. It is able to compensate the leakage of the buffer liquid at the double mechanical seals to avoid drying running of the seals, thus improve the performance and duty life of the seals. 
 The buffer liquid flows to the thermosiphon from the double mechanical seals with the principle of Thermosiphon Effect (or by forced circulation), and returns to the seals being exchanged and cooled. 
 The thermosiphon is built in SS304 or SS316L, with pressure gauge, sight glass, all necessary connection nozzles and brackets for easy installation. The tank can be built with or without cooling coil with the purpose to cool the buffer liquid by cooling water.

 PerMix Continuous Deaerators operate by creating a vacuum environment where air and gas bubbles can be efficiently extracted. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of the process: 
 
 Product Feeding: The material is fed into the deaerator, typically via a pump, ensuring continuous operation without interruptions. 
 Vacuum Creation: A precisely controlled vacuum is applied to the processing chamber to lower the pressure and release trapped air and gases from the product. 
 Centrifugal Action (Optional): For certain applications, centrifugal force may be used to assist in separating air and gas from the product. 
 Mixing Integration: High-shear mixing is incorporated to ensure uniformity, breaking down any remaining air pockets and achieving consistent product quality. 
 Discharge: The deaerated product exits the system, ready for packaging or further processing. 
 
 PerMix’s systems are designed with advanced engineering, ensuring seamless integration with your existing production line and requiring minimal maintenance.

 By a selection of different rotating element, PT-C Powder Induction Mixer is able to provide various functions of: 1. High volume powder induction, 2. Dispersing of “difficult-to-wet” powder, 3. Handling the fine dusty powders, 4. Homogenizing, 5. Emulsifying, etc. 
 PerMix offers four (4) types of Powder Induction Mixers, covering the common product range in the market: (1) PT-C/Q (Double Wall Design) (2) PT-C/Y (Special Stator Rotor) (3) PT-C/F (Two Pumps Design) (4) PCH (Shear Pump) 
 With its many distinguished features and options, PerMix PT-C Powder Induction Mixers are widely used in mixing of almost all kinds of powdery products by a variety of industries, e.g. food and beverage, dairy care, pharmaceutical, chemical. 
 The four types of Powder Induction Mixers share similar working principle, but with some difference: (1) PT-C/Q (Double Wall Design Powder Induction Mixer) 
 The PerMix PT-C/Q Powder Induction Mixer is the most common type which is also called Tri-blender. It has two key parts, a casing pipe and a stator rotor system. 
 The casing pipe is built vertically and coaxially into the stator rotor system inlet. This double-wall design prevents the powder going through the casing pipe contacting the liquid and forming lumps before they both arrive at the stator rotor system. As the rotor running at high speed during operation, liquid enters into the chamber and a water ring is created. 
 Vacuum is generated at the center which causes suction of the powder from the hopper above the chamber. A valve at the bottom of the hopper is used to regulate the falling rate of the powder. As soon as the powder gets in contact with the liquid, it is wetted and dispersed into the liquid by the turbulence and later high shear force when the mixture goes through the precise machined clearance between the stator and rotor, and radiated out through the stator openings. 
 By choosing different types of stator rotor, it can provide various functions of powder wetting, homogenizing, etc. PerMix provides high shear stator/rotor, low shear stator/rotor; and in some cases where the powder is easily being dissolved into the liquid, only a regular centrifuge pump impeller is used without a stator, and it provides higher volume flow rate and bigger powder induction rate. 
 
 PT-C/Y (Special Stator Rotor Powder Induction Mixer) PerMix PT-C/Y series Powder Induction Mixer has a very specially designed stator/rotor, which works by the principle of a water ring pump, that is able to produce relatively high vacuum; this vacuum makes the PT-C/Y Powder Induction Mixer able to suck the powder through a hand-held wand from a bag or other container at ground level. The powder can also be incorporated from a vertical hopper by gravity at a much higher powder sucking rate. 
 
 (3) PT-C/F (Two Pumps Design Powder Induction Mixer) The PT-C/F Powder Induction Mixer System is designed with the combination of a self-priming pump and an inline homogenizing mixer. The self-priming pump draws the liquid from an external container, and when the liquid passes through a venturi pipe which is located at the bottom of a powder hopper, vacuum is generated there and sucks the powder from above. The powder/liquid mixture will first pass through the self-priming pump, and later get further sheared and dispersed at the inline homogenizing mixer. 
 (4) PCH (Shear Pump) By adding a hopper at the inlet of the liquid, our PCH Shear Pump can be converted to a Powder Induction Mixer, to provide perfectly good sucking performance for dry and free flowing powders, for example, milk powder, dry flour, etc. Due to the relatively simple and compact design and full stainless steel construction, the PCH is popular in many hygienic applications.

 PAM Vertical Paddle Mixers, part of our powder mixers collection, are efficient and versatile blending machines for batch mixing of free-flowing powders, granules, and pellets. They have been used widely in food, enzyme, cosmetics, fine chemicals, & pharmaceutical industries. 
 Our Vertical Paddle Mixers allow the material particles and ingredients to be mixed with minimal mechanical and thermal stress, which makes this type of mixer a good solution for fragile and heat-sensitive products. 
 PerMix PAM Vertical Mixers are designed with a single shaft with only one ribbon, but is able to provide a multi-dimensional movement of the materials. The ribbon inside the mixing vessel moves the materials upward from the bottom to the top, where the materials then drop by gravity into the center. This generates a good counter flow of the product particles. 
 The ribbon design ensures that the linear speed of the particles are different from here to there, which results in a turbulence flow field. During this continuous operation, material particles and heat are exchanged quickly which leads to a homogeneous product. 
 A high speed chopper can be mounted to provide intensive mixing and/or lump breaking. This is very useful when liquid is added to the powery materials and generate lumps. 
 The PAM mixers have a cylindrical body with conical bottom, but sometimes can be with flat bottom and scrapers to assist the discharge. 
 A side mounted access door is included for most of the models for inspection and cleaning purpose, and it is designed to be flush-fitting without creating blind areas for mixing and cleaning. At the bottom of the cone, there is a flush-fitting plug valve (manually or pneumatically operated) for product discharge. 
 
 High level of accuracy with minor component ratio to be 1:1,000,000 
 Gentle mixing for sensitive materials without generation of heat 
 Chopper to be installed for intensive mixing and lump breaking 
 Low minimal feeding volume required 
 Full discharge with minimal residue 
 Easy to clean in either dry or wet way 
 High heat transfer rate, ideal for heating or cooling process of the powders 
 
 CIP spraying balls PerMix PAM mixers can be designed for CIP (Clean-in-Place) with spraying balls for both the mixing vessel and the discharge area. 
 Heating/Cooling jacket Jacketed vessel for heating/cooling operation by steam, thermal oil, or water. ASME/PED certificate can be optional for high pressure operation. 
 Vacuum drying & deaerating PeMix PAM mixers can be designed for vacuum drying & deaerating or for inner pressure working for special applications. See our Vacuum Mixers & Dryers section for more info 
 Spray nozzle for liquid addition Liquid can be added into the powder by spray nozzles which is installed on the top of the mixing vessel. The necessary pump and tank can also be provided by PerMix. 
 Feeding & Discharging A variety of feeding & discharging methods can be selected by the customers. 
 Shorter version with flat bottom PAM mixers can be designed with a flat bottom to reduce the total height, in order to fit in a limited ceiling height. A bottom scraper is mounted to improve the discharge speed and reduce the residues. 
 Construction material PerMix can offer mixers with contact part built in Carbon steel, SS304, SS316/316L, Titanium, Duplex SS, Hastelloy, etc. For abrasive materials we offer hardened steel, or the mixing elements to be coated with materials such as Tungsten Carbide.

For these reasons, the Magnetic agitator is regarded as the most sanitary mixer with almost no cross-contamination problems. 
 The range of PerMix Magnetic Mixers use special magnetic driving and non-sealing technology, which is totally different from the common gear-drive agitators. In a magnetic mixer, the magnetic couplings transmit the torque from the drive to the impeller by the magnet field. 
 No direct touch of the impeller with the drive is necessary, therefore no need for the conventional sealing, also they are working nearly without mechanical wear, which makes it possible that these magnetic mixers have much longer duty life with correct design and under proper working conditions. 
 The PerMix Magnetic Mixers mixing head can be equipped with several different mixing elements such as propellers or Rushton turbines. Biotechnology and fermentation are the most advanced fields of application in process technology. 
 For quite a long time, magnetic stirrers take over a leading role in high-tech agitation. There are also demands from other industries for Magnetic Mixers. 
 The PM series Magnetic Mixer is designed to be bottom mounted to the mixing vessel. A weld plate is firstly welded to the vessel bottom, and then the impeller is mounted from the top, while the drive is mounted from the bottom onto the weld plate by bolts or clamping. 
 
 High blending capacity with low power consumption 
 Highly hygienic design, easy cleaning and sterilization in the vessel by steam or hot water 
 Bayonet / Tri-clamp connection for easy assembly/disassembly of the drive unit (Option) 
 No sealing demand and no danger of leakage and contamination between batches 
 Low shearing for shear-sensitive materials 
 No wear of the mechanical parts leading to long duty life and minimum maintenance 
 Ex-proof version for flammable fluid processing 
 A variety of impeller types available for different applications

 When you want to produce stable emulsions and creams, wet and dissolve sticky powder (gums, thickeners, stabilizers), deagglomerate and disperse micro-phase solid ingredients (silicon dioxide, bentonite, titanium dioxide) into liquids without fish-eyes, or other similar tricky tasks, a traditional agitator is usually not able to achieve the expectation. However, the PerMix PS series High Shear Homogenizer Mixer is what you should choose to do the job. 
 PerMix High Shear Homogenizer Mixers work with a special designed stator/rotor working head. When it works, this stator/rotor head is able to draw the solids and liquids around it into its center, and then push them radially through the stator openings back to the tank. 
 During this period, the solids and liquids are subject to an action of milling and shearing which is so intensive that they are deagglomerated, homogenized and dispersed into each other even though they are immiscible by traditional agitation. 
 In the Batch process, the high shear homogenizer is immersed into the liquid. There are many installation methods for the High Shear Homogenizer Mixers, depending if they are top mount or bottom mount. 
 It can be lifted up by a lifting stand (hydraulic or electric), or it can be installed with flange on the top of a tank, or from its side, or at its bottom. For the vacuum or pressurized tank, the mixer must be equipped with a mechanical shaft sealing.
