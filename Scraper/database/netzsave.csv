Due to the synthetic material, surface protection nets have a high degree of elasticity and adapt optimally to the shape of the product. The net packaging is therefore suitable for protecting a wide variety of surfaces, corners and edges. 
 Buy various versions of plastic net sleeves online 
 NETZSAVE offers you a wide range of net sleeve packaging, differing in material thickness, size and diameter. In addition, the protective net sleeves have different colours (orange, yellow, blue, red, green, black and white) which represent different expansion ranges (5 – 600 mm) and thicknesses and are also intended as a form of identification. 
 In order to be able to offer you a suitable packaging for every need, we have arranged different product classes. 
 Standard Line - Eco 
 norm protection 
 For light to medium weight products 
 • Aluminium elements • Light metal profiles • Brackets • Fittings • Wooden products 
 Strong Line - Thick

 For medium to heavy and sensitive products 
 • Solid material Stee • Metal profiles • Heavy brackets • Glassware • Ceramic 
 Highend Line - Extra

 • Drive shafts • Piston rods • Machine components • Containers • Wood • Freshly polished / painted products 
 Special Line - Light 
 special protection 
 For light products and furniture components 
 • Furniture feet • Furniture frames • Components that should not receive any external scratches or dents 
 For heavy furniture elements or complex geometries with sensitive edges we recommend the “Eco” product line of net sleeves. 
 Application sectors for packaging nets 
 Protective net sleeves are used in many industries, such as the automotive, furniture and foodstuff industries, paint shops, sanitary facilities and in machine construction. They ensure optimum protection during production, internal logistics and storage. The net sleeves are also used as transport and final packaging. 
 Benefits of protective net sleeves 
 In addition to space-saving storage, net sleeve packaging offers many other advantages over other packaging methods. 
 Elastic and flexible fit 
 The packaging nets are formed of rhombic polyethylene mesh, making the material highly elastic and adaptable. This means that the sleeves can be easily slipped over the product being protected and, after use removed without residue. 
 Simple application and easy handling 
 To use the packaging material, cut the desired length of netting from the net sleeve roll. To make sure you don’t cut it too short, you can place the protective net sleeve over the product to be protected and then cut the sleeve to length. This simple and safe procedure reduces the risk of injury to the user.

For example, dirt is always left behind in the HSK tool holder on machine spindles. Despite meticulous vacuum extraction, material residues remain in the air during the machining of wooden materials, which are pressed on and adhere during later tool changes. This causes your machines to lose precision and results in dimensional deviations, surface flaws and even spindle defects. Our cleaning elements also have fleece cleaning strips with wide spaces between them, which means that the dirt can be better collected. In addition, the fleece material does not leave any lint behind, unlike conventional cleaning rags. 
 To offer you a complete and professional cleaning system, in addition to the internal cleaners for spindles, we also have external cleaners. The external cleaners are suitable for tool holders and as corrosion protection for tool-equipped holders that have to be stored. In addition, our rotary and taper wipers are also suitable for cleaning tasks on the sleeves of machine tools, presetting devices and balancing stations. 
 We have three product lines of cleaning elements in our range. These differ in design, size and shape. 
 Taper wipers 
 Applications for taper wipers 
 
 Cleaning the female tapers on machine spindles, tool adapters and sleeves. - Cleaning the tool adapters on tool setting equipment 
 
 Applications for cylindrical wipers 
 
 Cleaning cylindrical tool adapters and bores 
 
 Applications for external wipers 
 
 Cleaning the flange face of HSK tool adapters 
 
 Advantages of the tool cleaners 
 Rotary wipers extend the life of high-quality production tools, machines and presetting devices and prevent damage to tool holders. Our cleaning elements also offer other advantages: 
 
 The polystyrene body is dimensionally stable and enables precise use in contrast to wooden cleaning elements 
 The body of the conical wiper is resistant to external environmental influences such as temperature or humidity fluctuations 
 The polygon grip is ergonomic and non-slip, making it easier to use with large wipers 
 No abrasive particles (lint ) and high absorbency due to fleece cleaning strips 
 Fleece strips in grooves are hard-wearing and resistant to strong lateral forces 
 Long life due to the possibility of cleaning the fleece (from grease and oil residues) without loosening the adhesive bond

 NETZSAVE plastic protective mats offer effective surface protection for sensitive products during transport, storage and cleaning. The protective mats serve as flexible spacers that prevent contact between and damage to workpieces. The anti-slip mats prevent products from slipping and thus prevent damage to property and personal injury. The surface protection nets can be used vertically, horizontally or undulating as an interim layer to create a buffer between the parts. 
 In order to be able to offer you suitable protective mats for every need, we have arranged different product classes.

 Protective mats for transport and storage applications 
 Scratches can quickly occur on your products during transport or storage. Use of our protective mats can prevent this. The protective nets act as a separator and secure buffer, without taking up much space. The mesh ensures good air circulation for moist components. In addition to the two product categories “Strong” and “Extra” we also offer the flexible “Eco” version. Thanks to its fine-mesh and thin layer width, the parts to be packaged can be wrapped and thus offer even better protection.

The protective caps have a wide rounded opening, which facilitates the insertion of the object to be protected. The double-layer net sleeve provides perfect protection and elasticity. A secure retention of the plastic cap can be guaranteed due to the closed, rounded protective end. The protective cap end also prevents scratches or other damage to any points on the products. 
 Buy protective net caps online 
 NETZSAVE protective caps have an overall length of 80 mm, whereby the internal effective length is ca. 70 mm. To ensure optimum protection, you should consider the diameter of your products when ordering. We offer you two different versions to ensure that the thread protection caps fit securely. The orange protective caps have an internal diameter of 10 mm and are suitable for product diameters of 4 – 10 mm. The blue protective caps have an internal diameter of 15 mm and are suitable for product diameters of 10 – 15 mm. If you are looking for suitable surface protection for larger products, we recommend our Protective net sleeves. 
 Application sectors for surface protection caps 
 Net protective caps are mainly used in industrial sectors as point and thread protection. Among other things, the caps protect the male threads from scratches and other damage. They can also be used as transport and final packaging. The thread caps also provide optimum protection during production, internal logistics and storage. In addition, they protect sensitive medical devices during storage and sterilisation. As instrument protection caps they are therefore often used in surgeries or medical practices. 
 Advantages of thread protection caps 
 The protective sleeves provide a secure hold without the need for additional fixation. They are also easy to slip on and remove. They also offer many other advantages: 
 
 Resistant to external influences (scratches, damage) as well as being elastic and tear-proof 
 Waterproof and resistant to many greases, oils, acids and solvents 
 Environmentally friendly thanks to reusability and the possibility of recycling or residue-free incineration 
 Space saving and light due to the low material thickness 
 Colour coding aids identification and the mesh design make the products visible 
 No heavy metals and no plasticizers
